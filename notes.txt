Sampling is the idea of taking samples from a given distribution [0, 1) and converting that sample into an outcome

# Prior Sampling
 - Given some Bayes Net (BN), randomly generate samples and follow the BN from parents to children
   creating a list of outcomes

# Rejection Sampling
 - Given some BN, randomly generate samples, but if they samples are inconsistent with the evidence,
   reject the sample and continue.

# Likelihood Weighting
 - Given some BN, fix the evidence variables and sample the rest, calculating the weights for each
   outcome that relies on some fixed variable
